## Text to speech

# Requirements:  
Create python virtual environment and install requirements.  

python3 -m venv venv  or on windows: python -m venv venv/  

source venv/bin/activate   or on windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Note: if adding new requirements first do:  
pip install google-cloud-texttospeech   
then to save to requirements.txt:    
pip freeze > requirements.txt  

Create a google cloud project and enable their Text-To-Speech API,  
download a JSON credentials file (you can rename it as well) and put it in code directory.  

Create a .env with path, in this example it's in same folder as the code.   
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=service_account.json

python main.py "Hello this is a test"
